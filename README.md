# Ascii-Game
Ascii-Game created for a short project on a course

# What I learned
* Changing elements dynamically with javascript

# How I could improve
* It was a short project so I did not complete, so completing it
* I ran into issues with slow downs to complete stops however I could never replicate the issue, however I suspect it was the heavy loop use so I would work on optimising the rendering process to be less heafty
